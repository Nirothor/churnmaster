Churn Prediction Project: You are working on a churn prediction model and have been managing various aspects of the project, including data handling and model development.
GitHub Repository: You’ve been trying to push your local changes to a GitHub repository, but encountered issues due to a large file exceeding GitHub’s size limit.
Resolving Git Issues: We’ve gone through several steps to resolve the Git issues, including uninstalling xgboost to remove the large file, attempting to purge the file from your Git history, and force pushing changes to your repository.
Current Status: After uninstalling xgboost, you attempted to push your changes again. However, the large file still seems to be present in the Git history, causing errors when pushing to GitHub.
Next Steps: The next step is to ensure that the large file is completely removed from your Git history and to successfully push your changes to GitHub without any errors.
