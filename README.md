I’ve been working on a churn prediction model, managing various aspects of the project, including data handling and model development. I’ve also been trying to push my local changes to a GitHub repository, but encountered issues due to a large file exceeding GitHub’s size limit.

I’ve gone through several steps to resolve the Git issues, including uninstalling xgboost to remove the large file, attempting to purge the file from my Git history, and force pushing changes to my repository.

Currently, after uninstalling xgboost, I attempted to push my changes again. However, the large file still seems to be present in the Git history, causing errors when pushing to GitHub.

The next step is to ensure that the large file is completely removed from my Git history and to successfully push my changes to GitHub without any errors.

If I need further assistance with any of these steps or have more questions, I know I can ask for help here.
