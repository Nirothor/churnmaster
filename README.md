# Churn Prediction Application

Welcome to the Churn Prediction Application repository. This Flask-based web application is designed to predict customer churn using a machine learning model trained on customer data.

## Overview

The Churn Prediction Application assists businesses in understanding and predicting customer behavior, especially the likelihood of customers discontinuing their use of a service. The application processes customer data through a web form and provides a churn prediction along with the associated probability.

## Features

- **Churn Prediction Form**: A user-friendly web form for inputting customer data.
- **Prediction Results**: Displays the churn prediction and probability after processing the input data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Leverages a pre-trained model to make predictions based on input data.

## Installation

To set up the application locally:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SteveUseful/churnmaster.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd churnmaster

3. Install the required dependencies (Python and pip should be installed):

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Flask application:

python app.py


## Usage

Once the application runs, access it by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser. Fill out the churn prediction form with relevant customer data and submit it to receive a prediction.

## Code Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask application file with routes and prediction logic.
- `best_model2.pkl`: Pre-trained machine learning model for predictions.
- `preprocessor.pkl`: Preprocessing pipeline for input data.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web application.
- `index2.html`: HTML template for the churn prediction form.
- `static/`: Static files such as CSS and JavaScript (if applicable).
